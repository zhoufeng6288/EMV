The repository contains the EM-Variatinoal inference algorithm for GP modulated Hawkes process.
The synthetic data experiments have 4 cases, and real data experiments have 3 cases.
The algorithm has 2 versions: First version is for time-changing baseline intensity and Second version is for constant baseline iontensity.
